Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.

API (Application Programming Interface): An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

Example: Consider a weather forecasting application that displays weather information on a website. This application can use a weather API provided by a third-party service (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherStack) to fetch real-time weather data (such as temperature, humidity, and forecasts) and display it to users on the website.

Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.

Advantages:

Interoperability: Allows different systems to communicate and work together seamlessly.
Efficiency: Saves time and resources by leveraging pre-built functionalities instead of reinventing the wheel.
Flexibility: Enables developers to create modular and scalable applications by integrating external services.
Innovation: Encourages innovation and collaboration by exposing functionalities to developers for building new applications and services.
Standardization: Provides standardized interfaces for accessing and manipulating data and services.
Disadvantages:

Complexity: APIs can be complex to understand and implement, especially for beginners.
Dependency: Applications relying on third-party APIs are dependent on the availability and reliability of those APIs.
Security Risks: Exposing APIs can pose security risks if not properly secured against unauthorized access and misuse.
Maintenance: APIs require ongoing maintenance and updates to ensure compatibility and security.
Performance Overheads: Poorly designed APIs or inefficient API calls can introduce performance overheads.
Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.

Web API: A Web API is an API that is accessed over the web using HTTP protocols. It allows external systems to interact with web-based services by sending and receiving requests and responses in a specific format, usually JSON or XML.

Difference:

API: An API (Application Programming Interface) is a broader term that refers to a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications, regardless of whether it's accessed over the web or not.
Web API: A Web API specifically refers to APIs that are accessed over the web using HTTP protocols, making them accessible from any device connected to the internet.
Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.

REST (Representational State Transfer): REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, and data is typically exchanged in JSON or XML format.

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services. It relies on XML for message format and typically uses HTTP, SMTP, or other application layer protocols for message transmission.

Shortcomings of SOAP:

Complexity: SOAP messages tend to be verbose and complex due to their XML-based structure, making them less efficient for simple operations.
Performance Overhead: SOAP's XML parsing and processing overhead can lead to slower performance compared to REST, especially in bandwidth-constrained environments.
Tight Coupling: SOAP services often lead to tight coupling between the client and server, making it difficult to evolve or update the service without affecting clients.
Limited Browser Support: SOAP is not well-suited for browser-based applications due to its reliance on XML and complex message formats.
Q5. Differentiate between REST and SOAP.

REST (Representational State Transfer):

Architecture: REST is an architectural style.
Protocol: RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Message Format: Data exchange typically occurs in JSON or XML format.
Stateless: REST is stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all necessary information to be understood by the server.
Lightweight: REST APIs are lightweight and simpler to implement compared to SOAP.
Browser Support: Well-suited for browser-based applications.
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):

Protocol: SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services.
Message Format: SOAP messages are typically XML-based.
Complexity: SOAP messages tend to be verbose and complex.
Stateful: SOAP supports stateful communication between client and server.
Tight Coupling: SOAP services often lead to tight coupling between the client and server.
Performance: SOAP can have performance overhead due to XML parsing and processing.
