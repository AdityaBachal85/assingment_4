Templates can contain variables, control structures, and other dynamic elements that are replaced with actual data when rendered by Flask.\n",

    "The render_template() function in Flask is used to render HTML templates and pass data to them for dynamic content generation. It takes the name of the template file as an argument and any additional data to be passed to the template. This function simplifies the process of generating HTML responses and improves code organization by separating HTML markup from Python code."
