    "Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads (small units of a process) concurrently. Each thread represents a separate flow of execution within the same program. Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, so multithreading is more useful for I/O-bound tasks rather than CPU-bound ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used to enhance performance by allowing concurrent execution of multiple tasks. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with I/O-bound operations like network requests, file handling, or accessing a database, as threads can perform these tasks while waiting for responses without blocking other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `threading` module is used to handle threads. It provides an easy-to-use and high-level interface for creating and managing threads within a Python program. The `threading` module allows you to create, start, pause, resume, and terminate threads, as well as synchronize their execution using locks, events, semaphores, and conditions."
